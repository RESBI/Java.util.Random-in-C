# Java.util.Random-in-C
## As the title, this is a random number generating Algorithm called LCG (Linear congruential generator) which is used in Java's lib, I wrote it in C.
## The lib file is "lcg.c". You could just include it when you want to use.
## Actually, I wrote it in some weird way. So maybe using this lib is a difficult to you. 
## And, some ways to use it is different from native java lib.
## But it is fine, it works well(seems to be...). I'm just copyed almost all the codes from Java.
# "?????"
## This is an example program to show you how to use this lib.
## But nobody will see this repository, I guess.
